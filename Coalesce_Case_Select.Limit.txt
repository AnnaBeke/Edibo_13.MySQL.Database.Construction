MySQL: COALESCE Function

Description
The MySQL COALESCE function returns the first non-null expression in the list.

Syntax:
COALESCE( expression1, expression2, ... expression_n )

Parameters or Arguments
expression1 to expression_n
The expressions to test for non-null values.

Note
If all expressions evaluate to null, then the COALESCE function will return null.





MySQL: CASE Function

Description
The MySQL CASE function has the functionality of an IF-THEN-ELSE statement by allowing you
to evaluate conditions and return a value when the first condition is met.

Syntax:
CASE [ expression ]

   WHEN condition_1 THEN result_1
   WHEN condition_2 THEN result_2
   ...
   WHEN condition_n THEN result_n

   ELSE result

END

Parameters or Arguments

expression
Optional. It is the value that you are comparing to the list of conditions. (ie: condition_1, condition_2, ... condition_n)

condition_1, condition_2, ... condition_n
Evaluated in the order listed. Once a condition is found to be true, the CASE function will return the result and not evaluate the conditions any further.

result_1, result_2, ... result_n
The value returned once a condition is found to be true.

EXAMPLE- Includes expression:

SELECT supplier_id,
CASE quantity
  WHEN > 10 THEN 'The quantity is greater than 10'
  WHEN = 10 THEN 'The quantity is 10'
  ELSE 'The quantity is something else'
END
FROM suppliers;

In this CASE function example, the expression is quantity whose value would be compared to each of the 
conditions until one is met. Then the corresponding value would be returned by the CASE function.


EXAMPLE excludes expression:

SELECT
CASE
  WHEN a < b THEN 1
  WHEN supplier_type = 'clothing' THEN 2
  ELSE 3
END
FROM suppliers;

In this CASE function example, an expression has not been included so each condition is individually 
evaluated and can be completely different and unique. When a condition is met, the corresponding value would be returned.



MySQL: SELECT LIMIT Statement

Description
The MySQL SELECT LIMIT statement is used to retrieve records from one or more tables in MySQL 
and limit the number of records returned based on a limit value.

Syntax:
SELECT expressions
FROM tables
[WHERE conditions]
[ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ]]
LIMIT row_count;

Parameters or Arguments

expressions
The columns or calculations that you wish to retrieve.

tables
The tables that you wish to retrieve records from. There must be at least one table listed in the FROM clause.

WHERE conditions
Optional. The conditions that must be met for the records to be selected.

ORDER BY expression
Optional. It is used in the SELECT LIMIT statement so that you can order the results and target 
those records that you wish to return.

LIMIT row_count
Specifies a limited number of rows in the result set to be returned based on row_count. 
For example, LIMIT 10 would return the first 10 rows matching the SELECT criteria. 
This is where sort order matters so be sure to use an ORDER BY clause appropriately.

Example - Using LIMIT keyword:
SELECT contact_id, last_name, first_name
FROM contacts
WHERE website = 'TechOnTheNet.com'
ORDER BY contact_id DESC
LIMIT 5;

This MySQL SELECT LIMIT example would select the first 5 records from the contacts table where 
the website is 'TechOnTheNet.com'. Note that the results are sorted by contact_id in descending 
order so this means that the 5 largest contact_id values will be returned by the SELECT LIMIT statement.

If we wanted to select the 5 smallest contact_id values instead of the largest,
 we could change the sort order as follows:

SELECT contact_id, last_name, first_name
FROM contacts
WHERE website = 'TechOnTheNet.com'
ORDER BY contact_id ASC
LIMIT 5;

Now the results would be sorted by contact_id in ascending order, so the first 5 smallest contact_id 
records that have a website of 'TechOnTheNet.com' would be returned by this SELECT LIMIT statement. 
No other records would be returned by this query.
