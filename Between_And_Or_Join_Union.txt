MySQL: BETWEEN Condition

Description
The MySQL BETWEEN Condition is used to retrieve values within a range in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.

Syntax:
expression BETWEEN value1 AND value2;

where:
-expression is a column or calculation.
-value1 and value2-These values create an inclusive range that expression is compared to.

Note
The MySQL BETWEEN Condition will return the records where expression is within the range of value1 and value2 (inclusive).
When using the MySQL BETWEEN Condition with dates, be sure to use the CAST function to explicitly convert the values to dates.

EXAMPLE:
SELECT *
FROM contacts
WHERE contact_id BETWEEN 100 AND 200;

IS EQUIVALENT TO:

SELECT *
FROM contacts
WHERE contact_id >= 100
AND contact_id <= 200;

EXAMPLE WITH DATE:
SELECT *
FROM order_details
WHERE order_date BETWEEN CAST('2014-02-01' AS DATE) AND CAST('2014-02-28' AS DATE);

EXAMPLE WITH NOT OPERATOR:
SELECT *
FROM suppliers
WHERE supplier_id NOT BETWEEN 2000 AND 2999;
